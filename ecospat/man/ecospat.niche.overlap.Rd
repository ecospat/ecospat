\title{Calculate Niche Overlap}

\description{Calculate the overlap metrics D and I based on two species occurrence density grids z1 and z2 created by \code{ecospat.grid.clim}.}

\usage{ecospat.niche.overlap (z1, z2, cor)}

\arguments{
  \item{z1}{Species 1 occurrence density grid created by \code{ecospat.grid.clim}.}
  \item{z2}{Species 2 occurrence density grid created by \code{ecospat.grid.clim}.}
  \item{cor}{Correct the occurrence densities of each species by the prevalence of the environments in their range (TRUE = yes, FALSE = no).}
}

\details{if cor=FALSE, the z$uncor objects created by \code{ecospat.grid.clim} are used to calculate the overlap. if cor=TRUE, the z$cor objects are used.

If you encounter a problem during your analyses, please first read the FAQ section of "Niche overlap" in https://www.unil.ch/ecospat/home/menuguid/ecospat-resources/tools.html

\value{Overlap values D and I. D is Schoener's overlap metric (Schoener 1970). I is a modified Hellinger metric(Warren et al. 2008)}
