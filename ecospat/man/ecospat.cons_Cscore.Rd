\description{
Co-occurrence Analysis & Environmentally Constrained Null Models. The function tests for non-random patterns of species co-occurrence in a presence-absence matrix. It calculates the C-score index for the whole community and for each species pair. An environmental constraint is applied during the generation of the null communities.
}
\usage{ecospat.cons_Cscore(presence,pred,nperm,outpath,verbose = FALSE)}
\arguments{
    \item{presence}{A presence-absence dataframe for each species (columns) in each location or grid cell (rows) Column names (species names) and row names (sampling plots).}
    \item{pred}{A dataframe object with SDM predictions. Column names (species names SDM) and row names (sampling plots).}
    \item{nperm}{The number of permutation in the null model.}
    \item{outpath}{Path to specify where to save the results.}
    \item{verbose}{Boolean indicating whether to print progress output during calculation. Default is FALSE.}
}
\details{An environmentally constrained approach to null models will provide a more robust evaluation of species associations by facilitating the distinction between mutually exclusive processes that may shape species distributions and community assembly.
The format required for input databases: a plots (rows) x species (columns) matrix. Input matrices should have column names (species names) and row names (sampling plots).
NOTE: a SES that is greater than 2 or less than -2 is statistically significant with a tail probability of less than 0.05 (Gotelli & McCabe 2002 - Ecology)}

\value{Returns the C-score index for the observed community (ObsCscoreTot), the mean of C-score for the simulated communities (SimCscoreTot), p.value (PValTot) and standardized effect size (SES.Tot). It also saves a table in the specified path where the same 
metrics are calculated for each species pair (only the table with species pairs with significant p.values is saved in this version). }
