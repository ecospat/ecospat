\title{Niche Similarity Test}

\description{Run a niche similarity test (see Warren et al 2008) based on two species occurrence density grids.}

\usage{ecospat.niche.similarity.test (z1, z2, rep, intersection = 0, 
  rand.type = 1, ncores= 1, overlap.alternative = "higher", 
  expansion.alternative = "lower", stability.alternative = "higher", 
  unfilling.alternative = "lower")
}

\arguments{
  \item{z1}{Species 1 occurrence density grid created by \code{ecospat.grid.clim}.}
  \item{z2}{Species 2 occurrence density grid created by \code{ecospat.grid.clim}.}
  \item{rep}{Number of replications to perform.}
  \item{intersection}{Quantile of the environmental density used to remove marginal climates. See Details.}
  \item{rand.type}{Type of randomization on the density grids (1 or 2).}
  \item{ncores}{Number of cores used for parallelisation.}
  \item{overlap.alternative}{Alternative hypothesis of the test. See Details.}
  \item{expansion.alternative}{Alternative hypothesis of the expansion test. See Details.}
  \item{stability.alternative}{Alternative hypothesis of the stability test. See Details.}
  \item{unfilling.alternative}{Alternative hypothesis of the unfilling test. See Details.}
}

\details{Compares the observed niche overlap between z1 and z2 to overlaps between z1 and random niches (z2.sim) as available in the range of z2 (z2$Z). z2.sim has the same pattern as z2 but the center is randomly translatated in the availabe z2$Z space and weighted by z2$Z densities.

\code{intersection} allows setting if the niche dynamic indices (expansion, stability and unfilling) are measured across the full extent pooling the two study areas or not. If \code{intersection = NA}, the analysis is performed on the whole environmental extent (native and invaded). If \code{instersection = 0}, the analysis is performed at the intersection between native and invaded range. If \code{instersection = 0.05}, the analysis is performed at the intersection of the 5th quantile of both native and invaded environmental densities. Etc...


If \code{rand.type = 1}, both z1 and z2 are randomly shifted, if \code{rand.type = 2}, only z2 is randomly shifted.

\code{overlap.alternative} specifies if you want to test for niche conservatism (\code{overlap.alternative = "higher"}, i.e. the niche overlap is more equivalent/similar than random) or for niche divergence (\code{overlap.alternative = "lower"}, i.e. the niche overlap is less equivalent/similar than random). You can also specifiy if you want to test if you have more, less or different observed niche dynamics than random niches(with \code{expansion.alternative}, \code{stabilty.alternative} and \code{unfilling.alternative}). If you want to test for niche conservatism, we recommande to set these niche dynamic hypotheses to \code{"lower"}, \code{"higher"} and \code{"lower"} respectively for expansion, stability and unfilling.

If you encounter a problem during your analyses, please first read the FAQ section of "Niche overlap" in https://www.unil.ch/ecospat/home/menuguid/ecospat-resources/tools.html

The arguments \code{ncores} allows choosing the number of cores used to parallelize the computation. The default value is 1. On multicore computers, the optimal would be \code{ncores = detectCores() - 1}.
