\title{Dynamic Occurrence Densities Grid}

\description{Create a grid with occurrence densities along one or two gridded environmental gradients.}

\usage{ecospat.grid.clim.dyn (glob, glob1, sp, R, th.sp, th.env, geomask)}

\arguments{
  \item{glob}{A two-column dataframe (or a vector) of the environmental values (in column) for background pixels of the whole study area (in row).}
  \item{glob1}{A two-column dataframe (or a vector) of the environmental values (in column) for the background pixels of the species (in row).}
  \item{sp}{A two-column dataframe (or a vector) of the environmental values (in column) for the occurrences of the species (in row).}
  \item{R}{The resolution of the grid.}
  \item{th.sp}{The quantile used to delimit a threshold to exclude low species density values.}
  \item{th.env}{The quantile used to delimit a threshold to exclude low environmental density values of the study area.}
  \item{geomask}{A geographical mask to delimit the background extent if the analysis takes place in the geographical space.}

 It can be a SpatialPolygon or a raster object. Note that the CRS should be the same as the one used for the points.

\details{Using the scores of an ordination (or SDM prediction), create a grid z of RxR pixels (or a vector of R pixels when using scores of dimension 1 or SDM predictions) with occurrence densities. Only scores of one or two dimensions can be used.
\code{th.sp} is the quantile of the distribution of species density at occurrence sites. 
For example, if \code{th.sp} is set to 0.05, the the species niche is drawn by including 95 percent of the species occurrences, removing the more marginal populations. 
Similarly, \code{th.env} is the quantile of the distribution of the environmental density at all sites of the study area. 
If \code{th.env} is set to 0.05, the delineation of the study area in the environmental space includes 95 percent  of the study area, removing the more marginal sites of the study area. 
By default, these thresholds are set to 0 but can be modified, depending on the importance of some marginal sites in the delineation of the species niche and/or the study area in the environmnental space. It is recommended to check if the shape of the delineated niche and study area corresponds to the shape of the plot of the PCA scores (or any other ordination techniques used to set the environmental space). 
Visualisation of the gridded environmental space can be done through the functions \code{\link[ecospat]{ecospat.plot.niche}} or \code{\link[ecospat]{ecospat.plot.niche.dyn}}
If you encounter a problem during your analyses, please first read the FAQ section of "Niche overlap" in http://www.unil.ch/ecospat/home/menuguid/ecospat-resources/tools.html
The argument \code{geomask} can be a SpatialPolygon or a raster object. 
Note that the CRS should be the same as the one used for the points.
}

\value{A list containing RxR \code{RasterLayer} objects. Each object is the kernel density estimate of species occurrences or environmental values, with different scalings applied. Densities are calculated using the function \code{stats::density} for one-dimensional data, and \code{adehabitat::kernelUD} for two-dimensional data.

\itemize{
\item \code{z}: Species occurrences, scaled such that the sum of the density estimates for all cells is equal to the total number of presences in the original data.
\item \code{z.uncor}: Species occurrence estimates rescaled to 0:1, to facilitate comparisons with other species. 
\item \code{w}: \code{z.uncor}, coded as presence/absence
\item \code{Z}: Environmental values, scaled such that the sum of density estimates for all cells is equal to the total number of cells in the original \code{glob1}
\item \code{z.cor}: Species occurrences, scaled to correct for environment prevalence (i.e., \code{z/Z}).
}

In addition, the objects provided as \code{glob}, \code{glob1}, \code{sp} are returned as matrices. The bins along the first and second axes are returned as the vectors \code{x} and \code{y}.
